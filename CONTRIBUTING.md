# Contributing to LibPdIntegration

Thanks for considering contributing to LibPdIntegration!

At the time of writing, what the project needs most urgently is people who are willing and able to build libpd binaries for non-Windows platforms. The current binaries are all built to different versions of libpd, some of which contain notable bugs which have since been fixed on the [libpd master branch](https://github.com/libpd/libpd). What's worse is there's no documentation of which versions the binaries we do have were built to ðŸ˜±

If you're willing to build binaries for any of the following platforms, please get in touch via [issue #20](https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration/issues/20) so we can coordinate versions and start to get the binaries better organised. We need binaries for:

- Mac OSX (see also [issue #21](https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration/issues/21))
- Linux
- iOS
- Android

There are [generic instructions for building libpd binaries on the wiki](https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration/wiki/building-your-own-libpd-binaries), in addition to [specific instructions for building an iOS binary](https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration/wiki/iOS). Please do ensure you build any binaries with the MULTI and UTIL flags, as otherwise the binaries will not work with LibPdIntegration.

## Reporting Issues

Beyond that, if you've spotted a bug or have a feature request, first [check if there's an existing issue about it](https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration/issues), and if not, [post a new issue](https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration/issues).
